# React-Fitness-App

This is a front-end web page built in ReactJS as a fitness and exercise site.

I initially built this site in HTML and CSS.  Later, I decided I wanted to try rebuilding it with react components as a test of my skills.

The site is meant as a means by which users could more easily keep track of their workout routines.  Users would upload information about the type of exercise they did, the day they did it, and a unit of measurement regarding the amount of that exercise they did (miles jogged, pushups pushed, etc.).

It should be noted that this currently is an exclusively front-end project.  There currently are no databases storing user information, or waiting to store them.  Later, this feature may be added.

Some of the more noteworthy aspects of the current site include the dynamic line chart on the profile page, and the interactive calendar on the journal page.  These were integrated into the site via two different NPM modules that were installed into the code.

Other aspects of the site include the use of a linear-gradiant to create a background with a smooth color transition from purple to green on a diagonal angle.  In addition, text and divs were made to "pop" out at the user a bit using the CSS text-shadow and box-shadow properties, respectively.  Lastly, many divs and jumbotrons were given rounded corners using the border-radius property.
